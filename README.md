# DungeonsAndDragons-ToolAndBuilder

## What kind of a project is this?

This is a private project, which i have choosen to do purely out of passion for both DnD and Coding. This project will be a work in progress for a long while.
I plan on constantly working on improving it. The reason being that i want to have something that will help me advance my skill in .NET fullstack development, and also to make
a proper application which people who enjoys DnD actually can make use of. 

> The purpose of the app is split in two parts so far.
> The first part is that it will be a databank of sorts for everything that i manage to import into my many databases which i will use. My goal is that it will be
> a plattform where you can gather, and view everything that is needeed to know when either planning an adventure as a DM. or when questions arrive during an adventure, for Dm's and players alike.

> The second part is focused more on interaction with the program. I plan on making it possible for users to have a secure account with hashed passwords.
> With an own account, people will be able to build their on characters on there with a character sheet, collect items, import subclasses and do battles.
> Everything will be limited by the rules of DnD 5:e. Meaning you can only import a subclass when your level is high enough, you can only equip gear if the requirements are met etc.
> As for the battles: I plan on first implementing a battle simulator of sorts. Where you can chose to battle different kinds of opponents such as npc's, other players and monsters to view what your odds are in a real battle.
> If/When i ever get happy enough with the implementation of battles, meaning; its close enough to a real dnd battle, then i might recommend it for "live use" in actual fights in adventures.

## Current state of App:
